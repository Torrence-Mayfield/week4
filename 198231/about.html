            <p>AJR is an American indie pop band founded by brothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met, collectively a trio of vocalists, multi-instrumentalists, and songwriters. The brothers grew up in New York City, primarily focused on busking there and singing covers until their breakthrough as a boy band. The trio have been writing and performing music together since 2005. As of 2024, they have produced and released five studio albums under the independent label AJR Productions to various record labels.</p><br>
            <p>The trio broke out with their song "I'm Ready". The song yielded their first Platinum in Australia and also served as a lead single to their debut album, Living Room (2015). Their second album, The Click (2017), achieved one million album sales in America, making it AJR's first and only Platinum album; its singles "Weak" and "Burn the House Down" received triple and double Platinum (RIAA), respectively. Their co-written single on the album, "Sober Up" (featuring Rivers Cuomo), was certified single Platinum and reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Airplay chart. AJR continued to build audience with a world tour, supported by their first Billboard 200 top-ten and third studio album, Neotheater (2019). Two years later, a Billboard Music Award was granted to AJR's first and only Hot 100 top-ten single "Bang!", which was a double Platinum single from their second Billboard 200 top-ten and fourth studio album, OK Orchestra (2021). Prior to their fifth album, The Maybe Man (2023), AJR had over eleven million US digital single sales, which accounted for the five aforementioned songs, "100 Bad Days", and "Way Less Sad".</p>
